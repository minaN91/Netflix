In this projects the main goal was to extract some information about the actors, trends, and directors of the movies available on Netflix.
the charts are quite clear regarding the desired results but as a quick overview, I will review the tasks that have been done.

1. First, I have plotted the pie chart to demonstrate the total count for different types of ratings.

2. I took a look at the top 5 directors. so, the column related to the director's name has been checked and cleaned, grouped by and
sorted to achieve a clean sorted by chart representing the top 5 directors based on the count of content they have on Netflix.

3. the same procedure  has been done to extract the top 5 actors based on the related content and the result of analysis is shown as a bar chart.

4. another interesting analysis is to check the trends for production that has going on in each year. the line chart perfectly shows
that trend for different years again considering the total count of content produced that year and available on Netflix. after going through the line chart it seemed that there were a few (almost zero)
content before the year '2000'. hence, it seemed reasonable to just filter data and illustrate the chart starting after that year.

5. SEntiment analysis was another task performed in this project and the results were plotted as a bar chart showing the count of contents that lie into each sentiment class(neutral, positive, negative)
based on the year.
